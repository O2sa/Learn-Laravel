# Study Plan


If you're already a MERN stack developer and have a basic understanding of PHP from university, transitioning to **Laravel** (a powerful PHP framework) will be a smoother journey for you. Laravel is well-documented, follows modern programming paradigms, and shares many similarities with frameworks you might be used to in the MERN stack.

Here’s a structured roadmap that breaks down learning Laravel into logical chapters or breakpoints:

### 1. **PHP Refresher**
   - **PHP Fundamentals**: Brush up on PHP fundamentals, focusing on:
     - Basic syntax, variables, and data types
     - Control structures (if-else, loops)
     - Functions and arrays
     - Superglobals (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SESSION`)
     - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP
   - **PHP Composer**: Learn **Composer**, PHP’s package manager, to manage Laravel and other dependencies. Understand how to install Composer globally and use `composer.json`.

### 2. **Getting Started with Laravel**

# Laravel File Structure
Laravel's file structure is organized in a way that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring clear separation of logic, presentation, and data manipulation. Below is a detailed explanation of the file structure of a typical Laravel application:

### Root Directory
When you create a new Laravel project, you will see the following structure in the root directory:

1. **app/**  
   This directory contains the core code of your application. It holds the controllers, models, and other classes that make up your business logic.
   
   Key subdirectories:
   - **Console/**: Contains artisan commands. You can define custom console commands here.
   - **Exceptions/**: Contains the application’s exception handler. You can customize how exceptions are handled in this folder.
   - **Http/**: Houses the controllers, middleware, and form requests:
     - **Controllers/**: Contains the application’s controllers which handle HTTP requests.
     - **Middleware/**: Houses middleware that filters HTTP requests entering your application.
     - **Requests/**: Holds form request classes which contain validation logic.
   - **Models/**: Contains Eloquent models, which represent the entities in your database (e.g., `User`, `Post`).
   - **Providers/**: Contains service provider classes that bootstrap various services in your application.

2. **bootstrap/**  
   Contains the app’s bootstrapping scripts. It includes the `app.php` file that initializes the Laravel application and loads the configuration files.

   - **cache/**: Contains framework-generated cache files for optimization purposes (compiled files, routes, etc.).

3. **config/**  
   This folder contains all configuration files for your application, such as `app.php` (general app settings), `database.php` (database settings), `mail.php` (mail settings), etc.

4. **database/**  
   Contains database-related files, such as migrations, seeders, and factories.
   
   Key subdirectories:
   - **factories/**: Defines model factories to quickly generate dummy data for testing.
   - **migrations/**: Contains database migration files, which allow you to version-control your database structure.
   - **seeders/**: Holds seeder classes, which populate your database with initial data.

5. **public/**  
   The entry point for the application. This folder contains the `index.php` file, which is the front controller of the app and handles all requests. It also contains publicly accessible assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS files.

6. **resources/**  
   Contains the application's views, raw assets (uncompiled CSS, JavaScript), and language files.
   
   Key subdirectories:
   - **views/**: Contains Blade templates that are used to generate HTML for the frontend.
   - **lang/**: Stores language files for localization (e.g., `en.json` for English translations).
   - **css/**, **js/**: Raw CSS and JavaScript files that will be compiled and moved to the `public/` folder by Laravel Mix (a front-end asset management tool).

7. **routes/**  
   This folder contains route definition files.
   
   Key files:
   - **web.php**: Defines web routes for the application (handles routes accessed via the browser).
   - **api.php**: Defines API routes, typically for building RESTful APIs.
   - **console.php**: Defines console-based commands for Artisan.
   - **channels.php**: Registers event broadcasting channels.

8. **storage/**  
   This directory holds various storage files, such as logs, cached views, sessions, and file uploads.
   
   Key subdirectories:
   - **app/**: Application-specific files.
   - **framework/**: Contains files generated by the framework, such as cached routes and compiled Blade views.
   - **logs/**: Contains application logs.
   
   A symlink to the `public/storage` directory is often created to make user-uploaded files publicly accessible.

9. **tests/**  
   Contains your automated test cases. Laravel comes with PHPUnit out of the box for testing.
   
   Key subdirectories:
   - **Feature/**: Contains tests that involve making HTTP requests and testing user interaction with the application.
   - **Unit/**: Contains tests for unit testing specific classes or methods.

10. **vendor/**  
    This is where Composer (the dependency manager for PHP) stores all of the installed packages and libraries that Laravel or your application depends on.

### Other Important Files in the Root Directory

- **artisan**: This file is the command-line interface for Laravel. It offers various commands like running migrations, clearing caches, etc.
- **composer.json**: Defines the PHP dependencies for the project. Composer uses this file to install required packages.
- **.env**: This file contains environment-specific configuration, such as database credentials, application keys, and other sensitive information. It should not be committed to version control.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- **package.json**: Defines JavaScript dependencies for the project. It is used with Node.js and npm to install front-end assets and tools.
- **webpack.mix.js**: Configuration file for Laravel Mix, which is used to compile CSS, JavaScript, and other frontend assets.

### Conclusion
Laravel's file structure is designed to be logical and easy to navigate, ensuring separation of concerns while giving developers the flexibility to expand the application. Understanding each directory's role helps streamline development and improve the maintainability of your codebase.
